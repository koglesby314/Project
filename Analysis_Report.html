		<h1>Analysis Report</h1>

			Section 1: <br>
This project’s goal is to create an application that will act as a database of animals in Georgia. 
The outcome is to have an app that contains an easily navigable database of animals a person could check if they want to know about an animal. The information would include appearance, temperament, dangers it could pose, and other pertinent information.
The target audience for this app would focus on those who are outdoors and in places that may not have access to internet. These people would be hiking, biking, kayaking, or any other activity that may take them away from civilization. People may encounter an animal they need to know more about, such as finding a snake, or they may just be curious about a certain animal at a given time. This app would seek to solve this problem by having pertinent information readily available on a device. 
This app would be created using Python with the intention of posting it to the google play store.
Milestones:<br>
1.	Settle on a theme and layout for each page.<br>
2.	Begin working on coding the individual page formats<br>
3.	Research how the search function will work and get it coded

		Section 2:<br>
The product would need to be:<br>
•	Easy to use<br>
•	Have pertinent information people would want to know such as:<br>
o	Appearance<br>
o	Diet<br>
o	Behaviors<br>
	Social<br>
	Eating<br>
	When threatened<br>
o	Preferred habitat<br>
o	Species status<br>
o	Trivia<br>
o	Link animals by habitat<br>
Because I will be learning Python while creating this app, I will have to start simple and hopefully build on a simple base and improve as I learn more. To start with, the interface will begin with a search bar where a user would input animal, habitat, or other keywords to search for the animal they want to find. This would show a selection of animals that fit the criteria they searched for. 
While creating this app I wish to learn as much as I can about python. I want to learn how this process of creating an app is done.

		Section 3:<br>
The thought process I was planning to use is that people may want certain information, such as the appearance and pictures, behavior, and what kind of dangers it may pose. After that, the person may want to learn more about the animal, so general information should follow the more situational info. An easy to read font and colors that are easy to see in a variety of lighting conditions, such as outdoors in the sun and at night. The search bar should be obvious and easy to use.
Decisions (subject to change):<br>
Page Format		10	As previously stated, the format gives priority to pertinent information<br>
Font style 		2	Times New Roman – ubiquitous and simple<br>
Font size	 3             Large font for headers or section heads, like 16. 14 or 12 for small text<br>
Font color		4	Black – Easy to read and normal<br>
Background color	5	A white or cream color will let the text appear clearly<br>
Day and Night Mode	1	Not a overly important feature, it would just be nice<br>
Animal picture   	8	Pictures must show the animal clearly to aid in identification<br>
Quality of Information	7	Needs to be more reliable than Wikipedia<br>
Search function for app 	9	This is new to me, so I need to do more research<br>
Ease of use		6	Easy to use apps reduce frustration for the end user
		</p>

		Section 4:<br>
I am not sure what is meant by alternatives, because some of the criteria do not really have a viable alternative or I have not fully committed to a set design. Page Format should really give priority to information such as appearance, along with pictures, to help identify animals. The rest of the information may follow if the format is consistent between pages. The quality of information will need to be from a reliable source. For the font, any easily readable font would work, such as Calibri or Arial. The size is going to be subject to change because of how it may affect the page format and vice versa. The color of the font should be black, unless a night mode is implemented, then white or light grey would be good choices. Background color should be white, however cream would be a good alternative color. Black or a dark grey would be a good alternative if a lighter font color is chosen. This rolls into the potential for a day/night mode option. The day or night modes are a low priority, however they would enable greater flexibility for the end user. I stated the font size to be certain sizes, such as 16, 14, 12, etc. This may not be the best option. A dynamic size would be able to change based on different stimulus, such as user preference and phone or tablet orientation.
Now I need to talk about the search function. I have no experience with coding for this. I will need to do research before I am fully comfortable with using this feature. A viable alternative would be searching via menus. For example, select the location, such as South Georgia, then habitat. This would pull up a list of animals that would live in that area. Another list would let the person select the location, followed by the animal type, such as bear, dog, or bird. A combination of these would let a person narrow their search considerably.<br>
<br>
		Section 5:<br>
I have gone into some detail with the previous section, and believe I detailed most of what I would need to put into this section. Starting with the page format. The sections should start with the appearance, along with a picture. Next should be information such as behavior, diet, and how the animal is dangerous. This is the most pertinent information for people who may be using the app. Other sections, such as etymology, breeding and social behavior, and scientific classification will follow after. The font style must be easy to read, so complicated or stylish fonts are out. Three options are Times New Roman, Calibri, and Arial. All are common and easy to read. Consideration must be taken for the apps use on phones with small screens. The size of the font will also follow conventional format, with larger sizes being reserved for the section head. The same goes for bold and italicized font. The functions of background and font color are inseparable. If they do not mesh well it eliminates the criteria of being easy to use. With a light-colored background, a dark font color will allow for people to read easily. The alternative light font color, such as white or off-white, should be used with a dark background such as black, dark grey, or dark blue. This rolls into a day or night mode, which should allow the user to change if it is automatic, based on the time of day, or set to one or the other by the user. The animal picture must be easy to see and aid in identifying the animal. There is no alternative for this. The picture must come from a credible source. This source may be the same source as the information. Credible information is important. Now the search engine. This is possibly the most worrying criteria since it must work effectively. If it does not users will not be able to find the page and information they are looking for. I must do more research into how this will work before I can make more concrete decisions. The first option would be similar to a search bar function used by Google or Wikipedia that will take keywords and search for matches. Another option would have menus that would list and narrow down the search to a few options by selecting options such as the location, type of animal, and habitat it was sighted in.<br>
<br>
		Section 6:<br>
This section feels redundant to the two previous sections. Either that or I am doing something wrong. Most likely I am doing something wrong. The reasons I would choose the alternatives are based on my previous experience with using similar apps or websites.
<br>
		Section 7:<br>
I am still working on how to implement the first criteria, and I am not sure how I will implement the alternatives. Most of the implementation will be in changing the code for the app. 
<br>
		Section 8:<br>
I do not know how I can appraise the results of any decisions because I have barely begun making any. Likewise I cannot state if anything has been achieved by said results. I picked each of the criteria based on my previous experiences using websites or apps that are similar to what I am trying to create.
