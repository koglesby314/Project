		<h1>Most Meaningful Objective Report</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
The most meaningful learning objective during this project for me has been the overall goal to begin <br>
learning Python. This is a goal I had wanted to start for a while; however I have not had the motivation<br>
to do so in the past. This project of mine, the Georgia animal compendium, has helped me start that<br>
journey. I say I am starting a journey because I do not have a full understanding of the language. I would<br>
put myself at the level of a beginner when it comes to knowledge and skill when working with Python.<br>
			<br>
I started by watching YouTube and looking up resources online. I have a book, Python Crash <br>
Course, 2nd edition, that was a big help. The projects in the book were good for getting a groundwork<br>
down.  that had been sitting around and I have made my way through two thirds of it by the end of my<br>
project. W3schools was a help near the beginning, however I found myself skipping most of the lessons<br>
that covered the same material as my book.<br>
			<br>
I started from the ground up with my practice. I have some experience with Java; however I did <br>
not want to approach Python in the same way I did when I learned Java. I picked up speed with my<br>
practice instead of stagnating like I did with Java. By doing this I feel like I gained more and will retain<br>
more. I also have enjoyed learning Python so I know I will continue to improve my knowledge of the<br>
language. <br>
			<br>
Learning how the syntax was arranged was the first step. Python has syntax that is easier to<br>
understand than most languages. After having worked with Java, I find that I enjoy reading through<br>
Python syntax. Next came the variables, then data types. The data types are, to no surprise, like other<br>
languages data types. Much of Python will be easy to recognize if you are familiar with other<br>
programming languages. I studied then went over the many operators, as well as Booleans and strings.<br>
After studying data types and how to work with them, I studied how to store them, in lists, tuples, sets,<br>
and dictionaries. <br>
			<br>
I also started to learn SQLite not long after starting Python. SQLite would be essential for my<br>
program project. My project, the Georgia Animal Compendium, is made to be a database of animals that<br>
can be accessed using Python in conjunction with Kivy. Kivy is used to make an app interface that is easy<br>
to adapt to many screen sizes. SQLite is important because I need to have all these animals stored in a<br>
database that can be accessed by Python. I have done some classwork with SQL in the past. This<br>
previous experience made me think that SQLite would be easy to get through. I was wrong and ended<br>
up spending much more time getting my SQLite program to work. What I finally settled on was using<br>
SQLite3, which comes with Python in most cases, and created the database, tables, and inserted the<br>
data using Python code. This worked out as I was able to spend more time studying Python and working<br>
with its Kivy module.<br>
			<br>
Kivy was a completely new level of work with Python. I am no longer trying to get a printout in a<br>
terminal, instead it is a full module that enables one to make graphical user interface apps. The abilities<br>
that Kivy gives me, such as making screens that can be formatted to fit any display size, are powerful. It<br>
took quite a bit of time to learn because of the included kivy language. Kivy’s language is simple, and at<br>
its most basic can be used like cascading style sheets to format your program in a clean efficient <br>
manner.  I did not have to use the kivy language, however it helped to make my Python code<br>
significantly simpler to read and understand.<br>
			<br>
With all that being said, my inexperience has become all too obvious as I reach the end of the<br>
project. I have had to do more research for every step after I integrated my Kivy module. Simple actions,<br>
such as passing a variable between my Python Kivy screens, became tasks I had to study an hour or<br>
more to get to function properly. Several times during my project I found that my code was too<br>
convoluted or just stopped working. After spending multiple hours trying to get it to work, I found<br>
myself changing direction and redoing my project from the beginning. This is method has helped me<br>
understand Python better by getting a deeper understanding of the code I am using after having to redo<br>
it several times. An example of this would be __repr__. This function returns a formal, or official<br>
representation of an object. It has a sister function, __str__, which is the informal representation. At<br>
first, I had no idea of the difference between the two, however when I kept getting errors from using str,<br>
I learned about repr and how str’s informal may errors because of how it reads the objects.<br>
			<br>
Unfortunately, I hit a major roadblock with my project where I have been unable to get the<br>
variable that a user searched for to pass to a second screen that would then read the database to tell<br>
the user all the information about the animal they wanted to find. It is the due date for my project, and I<br>
am still having problems getting this to work. I will continue working on my project after writing this, so I<br>
may get it to work by then. If so, I will probably not update this to reflect that.<br>
			<br>
The problem, as far as I can tell from my trial and error, is related to the variables I have put into<br>
my animal page. The search result variable, which is passed from the main search screen and is<br>
supposed to be used in functions that get all the information from the database for the Kivy labels to<br>
display for the user. It seems that the local variables in the animal page are not passed a string and end<br>
up with one of two problems. First, if nothing is named for the variables, they end up with a None type<br>
which gives them an error because they need to have a string. If I start the variables with a string, they<br>
do not get the results from the function to pass to the labels. This situation has me thoroughly stumped<br>
as I have tried many different alternatives, and none seem to work for me. This problem is interesting to<br>
me and I will enjoy doing more research to figure out the solution after this course is over. My<br>
frustration comes from not completing the project on time.<br>
			<br>
In conclusion, I have enjoyed learning Python. The project for this course has helped get me<br>
motivated to learn Python and I will gladly continue improving my knowledge in the future. I hope that I<br>
can figure out a solution to my problem before my project is due. Either way, I think I have been<br>
effective in learning Python and that I will continue on learning after the course is over.<br>
