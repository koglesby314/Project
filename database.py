Gopher tortoises have a yellow bottom shell, with the rest of the tortoise being brown, or grey. Carapace length ranges from 6 to 9.5 in. Some examples are as large as 16 in. Gopher tortoises are herbivores, and their diet includes mushrooms, fruits, and grasses. They are known to live in colonies of several tortoises. The conservation status of these tortoises is important because they are a keystone species. The tortoises and their burrows are threatened by  habitat destruction and predation. Gopher tortoises are a keystone species because the burrows they make provide shelter for many other species.',
