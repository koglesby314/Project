		<h1>Senior Project<h1>
		<p>This is the shell for my project, an animal database, or compendium.<br>
		<small>This projectâ€™s goal is to create an application that will act as a database of animals in Georgia.<br> 
		   The outcome is to have an app that contains an easily navigable database of animals a person could<br> 
		   check if they want to know about an animal. The information would include information such as<br> 
		   appearance, temperament, dangers it could pose, and other pertinent information.<br>
		   The target audience for this app would focus on those who are outdoors and in places that may not<br> 
		   have access to internet. These people would be hiking, biking, kayaking, or any other activity that may<br> 
		   take them away from civilization. People may encounter an animal they need to know more<br> 
		   about, such as finding a snake, or they may just be curious about a certain animal at a given<br> 
		   time. This app would seek to solve this problem by having pertinent information readily available<br> 
		   on a device.
