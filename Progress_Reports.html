		<h1>Progress Reports</h1>
		<br>
		<h2>Report 1</h2>
		<p>
			Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:<br>
I have improved my knowledge of Python as well as SQL.<br>
I have a shell for the Python side of the app.<br>
Determined what sites I will get my information from.<br>
<br>
Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:<br>
Finishing or having a working version of my final Python code.<br>
Getting a frame for my SQL database.<br>
<br>
Root Cause of Variances: <br>
Main problem has been my work schedule. It began fluctuating recently because of developments at work and I am having difficulty balancing my time. <br>
The second major cause of the variances to my project has been my difficulty in making progress with the Python. <br>
The project has been more daunting than I previously realized. I have not done a similar project before and it is out of my comfort zone.<br>

The project has been more daunting than I previously realized. I have not done a similar project before and it is out of my comfort zone.<br>
			<br>
Impact to Upcoming Milestones or Project Due Date:<br>
I am going to be pressed for time later in the project. <br>
This will push back all other objectives.<br>
<br>
Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:<br>
Reevaluation of time, better time management. <br>
Communicate with professor when I have setbacks.<br>
If progress continues to stagnate, using a program or development kit, such as KIVY, to make up lost time.<br>
<br>
Root Cause of Variances:<br>
Same as previous root cause, poor time management and difficulty with code.<br>
			<br>
Summary of Upcoming Tasks<br>
The next tasks I must accomplish are to get a working Python app that I can integrate with an SQL database.<br>
Finish the SQL database and work on integrating it into the Python app.<br>
<br>
Planned Corrective or Preventive Action<br>
Better time management is key, when I experience setbacks I will try to get in touch with the professor or ask others who may be helpful.<br>
<br>

Accomplishments Planned for Next Reporting Period<br>
1.	Complete or have a nearly complete Python part of app.<br>
2.	Get SQL section complete or in a state that works so that only animal info needs to be inserted.<br>
3.	Get code for app styles completed.<br>

		<h2>Report 2</h2>
		<p>
		Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:<br>
Improving my knowledge of Python and SQL<br>
Have made a basic Python program that pulls information from the SQL files.<br>
I have decided on where my information will come from.<br>
<br>

Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:<br>
Complete or have a nearly complete Python app. ( While I have made significant progress in this respect, I have yet to be able to make the app user friendly.<br>
My SQL is not complete. Again, I have made progress, however I have not managed to incorporate many of the animals I wanted to have in the compendium. Also, because of the difference in animals, I have different sections in the database and that is causing complications with integration with Python.<br>
While  I have an idea of how I want the app to look in my head, I have not been able to add any style into my app. <br>
<br>
Root Cause of Variances: <br>
Again, my schedule is the main problem I have. It is difficult to sit down and work for any length of time with the number of hours I work. This has caused me to have to stop and pick back up frequently. <br>
I am also having trouble with Python, though I am making more progress as I increase my familiarity with the language.<br>
My main issue with SQL has been the sheer amount of information I need to sort through to add different animals into the database. I would like to research a way to put information in automatically, however I know that issues with data integrity would arise and I am not prepared to deal with that.<br>
<br>
Impact to Upcoming Milestones or Project Due Date:<br>
No major changes, as long as no more major setbacks arise I should be on time for future milestones and due date.<br>
<br>
Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:<br>
To prevent future problems I must utilize all the time I can to work on the project. If necessary, time will be taken off from work so I may finish as much of the project as possible.<br>
<br>
Root Cause of Variances:<br>
Again, my work schedule is going to be the biggest issue in regards to completing assignments.<br>
Other issues may be having difficulty implementing a more app focused layout, with buttons and such.<br>
 <br>
Summary of Upcoming Tasks<br>
Finish Python App format. This includes items such as buttons.<br>
Continue to work on SQL tables to have more data and integrate them with Python.<br>
Prepare a better video for the next demo video.<br>
<br>
Planned Corrective or Preventive Action<br>
Continue to work on time management.<br>
Vacation was taken later in November so that I am guaranteed to have time to do as much work on the project as necessary.<br>
If I encounter any major delays or setbacks I will notify the professor.<br>
<br>
Accomplishments Planned for Next Reporting Period<br>
Continue to work on Python and SQL code to smooth the program out.<br>
With Python, this means incorporating many of the columns from the SQL table that are not displaying properly.<br>
Work on and hopefully finish implementing buttons into the program. <br>
With SQL, Finish as many table entries as possible. <br>
I need to find a good testing environment to test the app.<br>
<br>
New Risks Identified<br>
Risk<br>
Failure to implement a mobile app format.<br>
Failure to import all fields in the tables.<br>
Issues<br>
My schedule will continue to be the largest issue I have, other than that it will be my inexperience with both SQL and Python<br>
Comments<br>
I am not sure I got the new risks and issues in the right place. Those are the only potential problems I see.<br>
I need to make sure to contact by phone number to make it easier to respond.<br>

		<h2>Report 3</h2>
		<p>
		Accomplishments for This Reporting Period:<br>
Further improved my knowledge of Python and SQL<br>
Nearly finished my Python app.<br>
Improved the layout of the app<br>
My SQLite code has gotten back on track and I will be able to finish it in time.<br>
<br>

Accomplishments Planned but Not Completed This Reporting Period:<br>
I had wanted to have my SQLite files integrated with my Python files<br>
I have not progressed enough to feel comfortable making a good demo video showing my progress<br>
Have the layout finished. While I have made progress, I am not done with the layout as there are small sizing issues and color issues to be corrected.<br>
I have more table entries for my SQLite.<br>
<br>
Root Cause of Variances: <br>
Again, my schedule is the main problem I have. It is difficult to sit down and work for any length of time with the number of hours I work. This has caused me to have to stop and pick back up frequently. <br>
I am still having trouble with getting all of the information I want into the tables and then displaying that information in the program. This has caused some frustration. <br>
I have had difficulty taking what I learned with my practice SQLite and translating that into the project. While I have made progress towards getting this to work, I am not quite there.<br>
<br>
 
Impact to Upcoming Milestones or Project Due Date:<br>
I do not foresee any major impact to the project due date or to upcoming milestones. While I have not made the progress I had hoped for, I have ensured I have more free time over the next two weeks that should ensure I accomplish my goals.<br>
<br>
Planned Corrective or Preventive Action:<br>
Once again, I need to utilize any time I have to work on the project. <br>
I took time off from work to ensure that I have the chance to finish over the next two weeks.<br>
<br>
Root Cause of Variances:<br>
Any problems I have with getting the SQLite files to function properly with the python will cause delays, however I have hopefully given myself enough time to work through these delays.<br>
My work schedule may continue to be a hindrance.<br>
 <br>
Summary of Upcoming Tasks<br>
Finish my python formatting. <br>
Continue to work on entering more data into my table, and get the database to function with the Python app<br>
Get prepared for the demo video ahead of time and make a better one than last time<br>
Finish the project and semester as best I can.<br>
<br>
	Planned Corrective or Preventive Action<br>
Time management is key. Even after I get to my days off of work I cannot slack off on my project.<br>
I scheduled off for the last week and a half before the project is due, so I am hoping that I will finish the project in that time.<br>
Any major delays will be brought to the professors attention.<br>
<br>
Accomplishments Planned for Next Reporting Period<br>
Continue to work on both the Python and SQLite code for the program<br>
Work on the formatting of the Python program<br>
Find a good testing environment<br>
Get the SQLite files to function with the app<br>
 <br>
New Risks Identified<br>
Risk<br>
Failure to import all fields in the table<br>
Failure to finish the project<br>
Lack of experience with Python and SQLite<br>
Issues<br>
Until my days off, my work schedule will be my biggest issue. My inexperience with Python and SQLite will be my biggest problem after that.<br>
