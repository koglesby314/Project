10/8/20	9	44	•	I am continuing to study Python and SQL. I Have started focusing on SQL to make progress with the database.<br>
10/9/20	5	49	•	Worked on SQL database. Had to restart.<br>
10/10/20	2	51	•	Jumped back to Python, also did some research on development kits and aids.<br>
10/11/20	4	54	•	I am fairly sure SQL is more difficult than I remembered. Updated my time log<br>
10/12/20	3	57	•	Made a choice to go with SQLite. This will work better with my idea for the database. I have avoided Python for now.<br>
10/13/20	3	60	•	Learning SQLite. Started a database of games I had played previously to practice.<br>
10/14/20	3	63	•	Worked on making a Python program that will work with the game database. Did not make much progress, however I have learned more about Python.<br>
10/15/20	2	65	•	Started a database for the project again. Focusing on less information, but hopefully it will be more direct and quick to access.<br>
10/17/20	6	71	•	Had computer problems on the 16th, so was not able to work. Had to restart the database when it seems like it was corrupted.<br>
10/18/20	8	79	•	Worked on having something to show during my video. I wont have much, however I am feeling good about what I will accomplish before the next video. Made a video.<br>
10/19/20	4	83	•	Returned my focus back to working on the Python aspect. I am working with the Pycharm IDE. It has definitely improved my work rate, where before I was using Geany.<br>
10/20/20	7	90	•	Making progress with Python. <br>
10/22/20	1	91	•	Managed to do a little bit of work with Python.<br>
10/24/20	3	94	•	Had to go back a little and rework my code. Getting better at Python and isolating/fixing small errors in my programs.<br>
10/25/20	4	98	•	Worked on both the time log and my second progress report. Have done more work with Python.<br>
10/26/20	1	99	•	More practice with Python<br>
10/27/20	2	101	•	Researched a IDE for the app, settled on kivy, which was reported as a good tool/module for developing mobile apps.<br>
10/29/20	2	103	•	Struggled to successfully import kivy<br>
10/30/20	6	109	•	Continued having difficulty with kivy, however I successfully implemented it after 2 hours, then worked with it for 4 hours.<br>
10/31/20	.5	109.5	•	Worked with Kivy a little. Went to bed early to get the most out of daylight savings time.<br>
11/1/20	1.5	111	•	Worked on time log and Kivy. For some reason my SQLite is not working with python like it was so I have to figure out that part of the project again.<br>
11/2/20	.5	111.5	•	Continued working with Kivy a little bit.<br>
11/3/20	.5	112	•	Continued work on Kivy. Made a grid layout for the app, however it has functionality issues.<br>
11/6/20	.5	112.5	•	More work with kivy and trying to get the layout sorted out.<br>
11/7/20	6.5	119	•	Got a basic Kivy program, attempted to pull snake information from SQLite, with no success.<br>
11/8/20	7	126	•	Continued to struggle getting SQLite to work with my program, also having trouble getting the format to stay consistent with resizing. May have to change layout. Finished this weeks timelog.<br>
11/9/20	7	133	•	Finally got my layout figured out. Main issue right now is having a search function that does not seem to want to work. All the resources I have had been no help on the matter.<br>
11/10/20	8	141	•	For my app, I have had trouble with the colors, however I am not as concerned for that as I am to have a mostly working program. Still stuck on the search function.<br>
11/11/20	10	151	•	There are currently three pages to my app, a main, search results, and the animals info page. These are probably all I need for my Python, so tomorrow I will start focusing on a database. Read feedback from previous timelog.<br>
11/12/20	5	156	•	Found a tutorial that might help, now planning on using a txt file as database. Its not elegant however I believe I can make it work.<br>
11/13/20	4	160	•	After working with the txt file, I have managed to understand more with the SQLite file. I have hope that I will be able to make the SQlite files function.<br>
11/14/20	2	162	•	Worked with Python and integrating SQLite<br>
11/15/20	3	165	•	Continued work with Python. Finished my progress report and timelog that will be submitted this week.<br>
11/18/20	2	167	•	Worked with database<br>
11/20/20	4	171	•	Continued with my database, however I had to restart. My columns were not set up how I wanted and my attempts to correct this ended in a mess.<br>
11/21/20	5	176	•	After finalizing my setup and adding animals to my database, I encountered problems integrating the database into my main python file. <br>
11/22/20	6	182	•	Tried to fix the problem, however I made no progress. The last three hours were spent creating and uploading the video because of recording software issues.<br>
11/23/20	2	184	•	Gave up trying to fix issues with python. Instead of trying to call from my other python files, I directly wrote the necessary code into my main file. It is not as elegant, however it has fixed the issue and I am able to work with my database in the main file.<br>
11/24/20	3	187	•	Checked on other deliverables in preparation for the end of the course. Added some popups into the app.<br>
11/25/20	7	194	•	I am stuck on making my kivy code read my database. It is stuck and will not pass the variable to kivy. This is frustrating because I feel this is the last thing I need to get the code to work.<br>
11/27/20	5	199	•	Still working on the issue with Kivy I stated earlier.<br>
11/28/20	7	206	•	I continued to struggle with trying to figure out why my code is not working. Worked on other documents while taking breaks from main files.<br>
11/29/20	9	215	•	Put everything I have into the GitHub. Tried to work on project app, but still had no success. Made video and got ready to submit everything I have left.<br>
