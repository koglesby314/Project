# Project

*I did not realize just how much I had to do on github. my README file is extrememly underdeveloped, however I will attempt to explain how to access my Python and get the program to work*

First, I used Pycharm to create all my __Python__, __Kivy__, and __SQLite__ files.

Pycharm is easy to download, going to the website, https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows, and follow the directions on the download page.
Kivy is more difficult, since you must use pip to download that. At https://kivy.org/#download, you must first select your operating system, then follow Kivy's step by step instructions.

I have added all the files I have for this project. Navigation should be realatively simple, follow the links. One page, Project Objectives, I left blank because I was not sure what to put in there as all that information is available in other sections of the project. I have included links to view or download the original documents for my project. I hope the site is easy to understand and if there are any questions you may contact me with the information that is provided on the site, and here.
