# Project

*I did not realize just how much I had to do on github. my README file is extrememly underdeveloped, however I will attempt to explain how to access my Python and get the program to work*

First, I used PyCharm to create all my __Python__, __Kivy__, and __SQLite__ files.

PyCharm is easy to download, going to the website, [PyCharm download site](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows), and follow the directions on the download page.
Kivy is more difficult, since you must use pip to download that. At [Kivy](https://kivy.org/#download), you must first select your operating system, then follow Kivy's step by step instructions.
Python is also necessary. Pycharm does not function well with the latest version of Python at the time of me writing this README. I went to Python's Windows downloads [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Then I selected version 3.7.1 and downloaded its executable installer. This version is fully compatible with PyCharm.

I have added all the files I have for this project. Navigation should be realatively simple, follow the links. One page, Project Objectives, I left blank because I was not sure what to put in there as all that information is available in other sections of the project. I have included links to view or download the original documents for my project. I hope the site is easy to understand and if there are any questions you may contact me with the information that is provided on the site, and here.
